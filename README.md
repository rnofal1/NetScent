# NetScent

NetScent is a packet analyzer/sniffer designed to monitor local network traffic.  

NetScent allows users to view a continuous stream of network information, including source and destination IP addresses and approximate geographic locations, for devices involved in the exchange of intercepted packets.

This project is currently in an early, unfinished state, but I will continue to add features and fixes over time.

## Purpose
This is a personal project, its main purpose is as a platform for me to use and improve my programming and C/C++ skills. However, in service of that purpose I will try to make this program as usable, useful, accessible, and performant as possible.

## How to Use
1. Ensure that you have an updated version of Linux installed*
2. Download the latest build
3. In a terminal, run this command (or similar): ```sudo ./<build_name>```

*Not guaranteed to work on all systems or configurations
